                For an MVP we build only the core features with no bells and

                able to show the application to potential users, investors,
                potential acquirer etc. Once there is feedback from
                users/investors- we can add more features, improve it etc.
                Modifications are done based on the real feedback that we get
                from actual users/investors/acquirers- no need to spend months
                and large sums of money to build a huge application with a tons
                of features that we think is good but the actual users could
                care less about.

                Ambitious development projects where a team decides to build a
                rocket to send to the moon from zero to hero â€“ are often out of
                touch with the target market, usually overloaded with a ton of
                (not needed) features, over budget, late and often fail (no
